1. Installed Variant Call Format (VCF) parser for Python from site "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyVCF"

2. Scanned records of mutect_immediate.vcf using vcf.Reader

3. truseq.bed file contains Region CHROM, Region Start, Region End

4. For every record of mutect_immediate.vcf, CHROM of mutect_immediate.vcf is matched with every record of truseq.bed file.

If mutect_immediate.vcf record.CHROM
lies between range Start and End of truseq.bed file, then we have found accepted mutation.

5. Accepted mutation is stored in 
a) accepted.txt
b) accepted.csv

6. Total no of accepted mututations=3408
